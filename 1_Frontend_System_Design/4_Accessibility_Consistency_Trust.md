# Accessibility

**Accessibility** means designing applications that are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities.

## ✅ Best Practices for Accessibility:

- **Semantic HTML**: Use tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<button>` to help screen readers understand page structure.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure full navigation using only a keyboard (tab order, focus states).
- **Text Alternatives**: Use `alt` text for images, `aria-label` for non-text elements, and captions for videos.
- **Color Contrast**: Maintain strong contrast between text and background for visibility (especially for color blindness).
- **Responsive Design**: Support all screen sizes and assistive tech for better usability.
- **Clear Error Messages**: Provide understandable error feedback to assist users with cognitive challenges.
- **Accessible Forms**: Use properly associated `<label>` tags for all input fields.

# Consistency

**Consistency** in design ensures a predictable and uniform experience across devices, browsers, and platforms. It improves usability and reduces confusion.

## ✅ How to Maintain Consistency:

- **CSS Prefixes**: Use `-webkit-`, `-moz-`, etc., for cross-browser compatibility.
- **Browser Fixes**: Apply conditional CSS or hacks to fix specific browser quirks.
- **Polyfills**: Use JavaScript polyfills to add support for modern features (e.g., Flexbox) in older browsers.
- **Design Systems**: Adopt a design system (e.g., Material UI) to maintain visual and interaction consistency across all components and platforms.
