# Frontend Architectural Patterns

## 1. Monolithic Frontend
- A single, unified application.
- One large codebase managed by one team.
- Deployed as a whole.

## 2. Micro Frontend
- Multiple independent applications (or UI parts).
- Each part has its own codebase and can use different tech stacks.
- Developed, deployed, and maintained independently.

| Aspect             | Monolithic Frontend                       | Micro Frontend                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Architecture       | Single, unified application                | Independent modules                                 |
| Codebase           | One large codebase                         | Multiple smaller codebases                          |
| Deployment         | One large deployment                       | Independent deployments                             |
| Scalability        | Hard to scale                              | Easy to scale                                       |
| Tech Stack         | Single framework                           | Multiple frameworks allowed                         |
| Development Team   | One team                                   | Multiple teams independently                        |
| Flexibility        | Less flexible                              | Highly flexible                                     |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Achieve Micro Frontends

- **Domain Split**: Divide frontend by features/domains; assign to different teams.
- **Independent Development**: Each micro frontend with its own codebase and lifecycle.
- **Independent Deployment**: Each part deploys separately without affecting others.
- **Communication**: Use custom events, shared state, or APIs for interaction.
- **Routing**: Each handles its own routes; a container app manages global routing.
- **Design System**: Use a shared component library for consistent UI.
- **Shell App**: Acts as the entry point and coordinates loading/auth/authentication.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- **Module Federation (Webpack 5)**: Load and share code between apps at runtime.
- **Web Components**: Framework-agnostic reusable UI components.
- **Single-SPA**: Framework for integrating multiple micro frontends.
- **Iframes**: Simple but limited method for integration.
- **Server-Side Integration**: Combine micro frontends on the backend.

## ‚úÖ Summary

To implement a **micro frontend architecture**, split your app into independently developed and deployed modules. Use tools like **Module Federation**, **Single-SPA**, or **Web Components** for integration, and coordinate them using a **container or shell app** to ensure a smooth user experience.
