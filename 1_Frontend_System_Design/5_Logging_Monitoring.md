## 📝 Logging

**Logging** is the process of recording detailed information about an application’s runtime behavior, errors, and system events. Logs help developers:
- Troubleshoot issues
- Debug errors
- Analyze unexpected behaviors

### 🔹 Types of Logging:
- **Error Logging**: Captures and stores system or application errors and exceptions for real-time debugging and reliability.

## 📊 Monitoring

**Monitoring** is the continuous tracking of system performance, user behavior, and infrastructure health. It helps detect issues early and optimize performance.

### 🔍 Key Monitoring Areas:

- **User Tracking**: Gathers data on user preferences and journey to improve experience and personalization.
- **User Activity Monitoring**: Tracks user actions (clicks, views, interactions) to identify engagement trends and pain points.
- **Feature Usage Monitoring**: Measures usage of specific features to guide product development and identify underused or high-impact areas.
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Monitors servers, databases, and system resources (CPU, memory, etc.) to prevent slowdowns or outages.
